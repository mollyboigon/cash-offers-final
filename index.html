                    <h3>Third-Country Nationals</h3>
                    <p>
                        As of <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/log/ps/.CENTCOM_reports.html/FY22_1Q_5A_Jan2022.pdf">January 2022,</a> there are 18,918 contractor personnel in U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility, which includes Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and other countries in the Middle East. More than 8,000 of those workers are what the government calls "third-country nationals" who are from neither the U.S. nor the country in which they are hired on contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Third-country nationals are particularly vulnerable to labor abuse and other types of human trafficking.

                    <h3>Labor Camps</h3>
                    <p>
                        Foreign contract employees on military bases leave their homes in other countries mainly to work on "logistics contracts" -- dining, construction and janitorial jobs on military bases. They often live all together in dormitory-style accomodations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A <a href="https://www.dodig.mil/reports.html/Article/1874544/evaluation-of-dod-efforts-to-combat-trafficking-in-persons-in-kuwait-dodig-2019/">2019 Department of Defense Inspector General report</a> found that the contractor who hired these men provided living accomodations that "did not have access to potable drinking water, were unsanitary, and infested with bed bugs.‚Äù

                    <h3>Working Conditions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Workers are also sometimes charged recruiting fees that put them in "a state of enslaved bondage," according to a <a href="https://www.dodig.mil/reports.html/Article/1874544/evaluation-of-dod-efforts-to-combat-trafficking-in-persons-in-kuwait-dodig-2019/">2019 Department of Defense Inspector General report</a>.

                    <p>
                        An former administrative contracting officer said these men were crying while talking about their situation, including the fact that they were paying off their debts and had "no money to send to their families."

            On U.S. military bases across the world, companies are hired on a contract basis to do work, including providing products like building materials and staffing cafeterias. 
         </p>
         <p>  
            Unfortunately, in the Middle East in particular, some of these workers are forced into labor on the bases. In some cases, they are charged exorbitant recruiting fees that send them into debt and funnel them into indentured servitude until they can pay back the loans. In others, their passports are confiscated so they cannot leave. In still others, they are subjected to poor living and working conditions in harsh elements, and suffer mental and physical health issues that persist long past their periods of labor.
        </p> 
        <p>
        The U.S. has explicit laws and regulations banning trafficking in persons violations like these, but experts say that compliance checks are perfunctory and the same contractors are hired again and again out of convenience -- despite accusations of labor trafficking.
